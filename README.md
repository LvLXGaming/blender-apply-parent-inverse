# blender-apply-parent-inverse

A plugin to reset blender's parent inverse antifeature without breaking everything. Thanks to [ideasman42 on StackExchange](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/28897/83714) for the code that makes this possible.

Currently 2.79 only, 2.80 version will come when I start using 2.80, or if enough people want it.

## Installation
To install, simply clone or copy this repository into your blender `addons` folder and enable it in the preferences like any other plugin.

## Usage
This plugin adds a single item called "Apply Parent Inverse" to the Object menu. By default, this action is bound to `⇧-⌥-P` (`⇧-alt-P` on windows and linux)
